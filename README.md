!!WORKS ONLY WITH DEFAULT CAST BAR!!

## Installation

Extract into 3.3.5-WoW-folder/Interface/AddOns. Run the game. Enable AddOn in the in-game AddOn menu. (Should be enabled by default for first-time installers.)

## What does it do?

Whenever you cast a healing spell with a cast time greater than 0, the default cast bar shows who your target is, as well as which spell you are casting.

## Known bugs

 -- Unfortunately, there's no way to 100 % accurately get the target of your spell, which leads to wrong information whenever player switches targets right after casting a healing spell. There's really no fix for this, so be warned.  
 -- As of version 1.1, the AddOn doesn't differentiate between factions, meaning it might show you healing an ally when you're horde. This will more than likely be dealt with in the future.
